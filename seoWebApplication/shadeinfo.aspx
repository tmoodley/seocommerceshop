<h1>Shade Information</h1>
<div id=wrapper-login> 
	  There is a global awareness that skin cancer is now classified as an epidemic. National results in the United States show alarming statistics that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer as reported by the Skin Cancer Foundation. Changes in man’s lifestyle and habits have contributed to this increase, yet the education and changes in attitudes have not changed as quickly to meet this problem. Another major cause is due to the depletion of the ozone layer which has allowed more cancer-causing rays to affect us directly on earth.

These facts have promulgated various sun safe strategies which are now becoming accepted national health and safety policies in schools and communities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), CDC, Centers for Disease Control, and other bodies e.g. The Shade Foundation, Sun Safety Alliance are spearheading a new consciousness to America’s youth through sun safe school education and awareness programs on how to protect themselves and reduce their skin cancer risk from solar UV of the sun.

	  <div>WHAT IS SOLAR ULTRAVIOLET (UV) RADIATION?

UV radiation is emitted by the sun, and may increase school children’s risk of skin cancer by excessive over exposure in unprotected outdoor school grounds. Because UV radiation cannot be seen or felt, it poses a challenge to educate the public on its harmful effects.

		<p><b>Following is a list of factors that influence the intensity of solar UV.</b> <br>
		

Sun Height – The higher the sun in the sky, the higher the UV level. Maximum levels generally occur when the sun is directly overhead. (solar noon)
Latitude – The closer the equator the higher the UV levels.
Ozone – The ozone layer absorbs some of the UV radiation, however with the mass thinning of this layer we are more at risk from overexposure than ever before.
Altitude – Higher altitude causes less UV radiation filter. UV levels increase by 8% with every 1000 meters higher.
Environment – Different surfaces reflect different percentages of UV, e.g snow 80%, dry beach sand 15%. This is known as indirect UV.
